"""
You work for a company that makes weights that are used for balancing scales in high school science classes. The 
weights are shipped in boxes, and each box contains weights in a certain range. Each box is labeled with an array 
that represents the weights it contains. For example, a box of weights from 4 to 12 is labeled [4, 12]. The company 
never ships the same weight twice in a shipment.

A high school that needs a new set of weights orders a package that consists of several boxes. Once in a while, something 
goes wrong and either one weight falls off the line, or one weight is accidentally added to one of the boxes. Your job is
 to check each package before it goes out, and detect if this is the case.

Given the labels of the boxes about to be shipped and the actual packageWeight, you should return:

0 if the provided actual packageWeight equals the package weight you would expect according to the label;
a if weight a was accidentally added to the package;
-a if weight a is missing from the package.
Example

For boxes = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and packageWeight = 10, the output should be
checkWeights(boxes, packageWeight) = 0.

The total expected weight of the package is (1 + 2) + (3 + 4) = 10, which is equal to the packageWeight.

For boxes = [[1, 3], [8, 10]] and packageWeight = 35, the output should be
checkWeights(boxes, packageWeight) = 2.

The total expected weight of the package is (1 + 2 + 3) + (8 + 9 + 10) = 33, which means that a weight weighing 2 was accidentally 
added to the package.

For boxes = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and packageWeight = 6, the output should be
checkWeights(boxes, packageWeight) = -4.

The total expected weight of the weights is (1 + 2) + (3 + 4) = 10, which means that weight 4 is missing from the package.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] array.array.integer boxes

A list of boxes, where each box is labeled as described above.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ boxes.length < 10,
boxes[i].length = 2,
1 ≤ boxes[i][0] < boxes[i][1] ≤ 1000,
boxes[i][1] < boxes[i + 1][0].

[input] integer packageWeight

The actual total weight of the package

Guaranteed constraints:
5 < totalWeight < 106.

[output] integer

Return 0 if the weight of the set of weights in boxes is equal to packageWeight. If the weight of the set of weights in boxes is 
less than or greater than packageWeight, return the amount of weight that needs to be removed from or added to boxes.
