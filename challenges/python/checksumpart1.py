"""
Given the first 11 digits of a GTIN-12 barcode as an integer (i.e. without leading zeros), determine the last number 
by calculating the value of the check digit.

Example

For a = 29104150021, the output should be
checksum_part1(a) = 9.

The digit sum can be calculated as follows, using the information in the link above:

You know that you need to multiply the digit at N1 by 3, the digit at N2 by 1, and so on, then add these numbers together: 
2 * 3 + 9 * 1 + 1 * 3 + 0 * 1 + 4 * 3 + 1 * 1 + 5 * 3 + 0 * 1 + 0 * 3 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 3 = 51

Then, you need to subtract that sum from the nearest equal or higher multiple of ten: 60 - 51 = 9.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] integer64 barcode

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ barcode < 1011.

[output] integer

The last digit of the barcode.
